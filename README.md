## Introduction

In this project, we will:
- Learn how to extract features for logistic regression from text data.
- Implement logistic regression from scratch.
- Apply logistic regression to a natural language processing task.
- Test the logistic regression model.
- Perform error analysis.

We will use a dataset of tweets to achieve over 99% accuracy.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following libraries installed:
- `nltk`
- `numpy`
- `pandas`

You can install these using pip:

```bash
pip install nltk numpy pandas
```

### Sigmoid Function

Defines the sigmoid function used in logistic regression.

### Cost Function and Gradient

Defines the cost function and gradient descent algorithm for model optimization.

### Feature Extraction

Methods to extract relevant features from the tweet text.

### Model Training

Training the logistic regression model using the training dataset.

### Model Testing

Predicting sentiment on test data and evaluating model performance.

### Error Analysis

Analyzing the errors to understand the model's weaknesses and improve it.

### Predicting Custom Tweets

Using the trained model to predict the sentiment of user-defined tweets.

## Running the Notebook

1. Clone the repository or download the notebook.
2. Ensure all prerequisites are installed.
3. Run each cell sequentially to train and test the model.
4. Use the last section to test custom tweets.

## Results

The logistic regression model is expected to achieve high accuracy in predicting the sentiment of tweets.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how to build a sentiment analysis model using logistic regression. By following the steps outlined, you can understand the workflow of feature extraction, model training, testing, and error analysis.
